    Rikard Mohlin underwent his Isha Hatha Yoga Teacher training in 2021 at the Isha Yoga Center, located in the foothills of Vellangiri
    mountains in southern India. Brought up in south of Sweden he moved abroad after High School, having a simple and minimalistic way of
    living and an approach to life that always was on the cross side. This led him to try out different forms of yoga and meditation before
    coming to isha. "The moment I sat in my first Isha Yoga Class, I knew this is it, this is the way Yoga should be taught and practised."

  <p>Rikard is now teaching regularly in Sweden and is conducting workshops in Stockholm and Malm√∂ as well as online on a regular basis.</p>
